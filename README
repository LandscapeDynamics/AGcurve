AGcurve is a small R library of functions used for performing spatial
point pattern analysis using the AG-curve (agglomerative) technique. The
AG-curve is, basically, a graphical representation of a cluster dendrogram
that illustrates the rate of cluster merging. The original work on the
AG-curve was done by Takai, Tamura and Motoyama, 2017 (A New Graphical
Approach to Classify Spatial Point Patterns Based on Hierarchical
Cluster Analysis, J Japanese Society of Computational Statistics 30(1):
1-14. https://dx.doi.org/10.5183/jjscs.1611001_229).

To install in R you will first want to ensure you have the devtools
library installed.

# If you don't have it yet, launch R and install 'devtools':
install.packages('devtools')
# Then install the AGcurve package:
devtools::install_github('bjornbrooks/AGcurve')
# Finally refer to the manual for useful demos. Then explore and enjoy!
