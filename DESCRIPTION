Description: AGcurve is a small package of functions used for performing
    spatial point pattern analysis using the AG-curve (agglomerative)
    technique. The AG-curve is, basically, a graphical representation of
    a cluster dendrogram that illustrates the rate of cluster merging.
    The original work on the AG-curve was done by
    Takai, Tamura and Motoyama, 2017 (A New Graphical Approach to
    Classify Spatial Point Patterns Based on Hierarchical Cluster
    Analysis, J Japanese Society of Computational Statistics 30(1): 1-14.
